## View Binding

Connecting data in views, with data in code.

Google Docs: https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding

1. Enable viewBinding in build.gradle for your module 

2. "If view binding is enabled for a module, a binding class is generated for each XML layout file that the module contains. 
   Each binding class contains references to the root view and all views that have an ID. 
   The name of the binding class is generated by converting the name of the XML file to Pascal case and adding the word "Binding" to the end.

Thus, activity_main.xml has a binding class called ActivityMainBinding.

```
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    private lateinit var binding: ActivityMainBinding

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
        val view = binding.root
        setContentView(view)
    }
}

```

3. Then, can access any view component that has an id, as a property of the binding object.
Note that the names are converted to pascal case, so an ID `kitten_radio` is accessed using `binding.kittenRadio` in code.
